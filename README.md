pattern-fill
============

Highcharts plugin for creating pattern fills in any area, like area charts, chart backgrounds, plot bands or columns.

## Usage
In version 2, add a `defs` object to the options. Create a `patterns` array under `defs`. Each item in this array represents a pattern. To use a pattern, set the color to `url(#id-of-pattern)`. Version 1 worked with oldIE, but the downside is that image files are required for the patterns.

```js
    defs: {
        patterns: [{
            'id': 'custom-pattern',
            'path': {
                d: 'M 0 0 L 10 10 M 9 -1 L 11 1 M -1 9 L 1 11',
	            stroke: Highcharts.getOptions().colors[0],
    	        strokeWidth: 3
            }
        }]
    },
```
